# 20XX-Melee-Hack-Pack

Decipio-Carmen's branch of the 20XX code libraries, forked from [Achilles' Github repository](https://github.com/Achilles1515/20XX-Melee-Hack-Pack)

### How is this legal?
The data in this repository contains nothing more than custom code. No game files are being distributed. This makes it no different than the distribution of Action Replay and Gameshark devices, which is also legal.
